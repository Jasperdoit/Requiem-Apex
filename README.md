# Requiem-Apex

RIP Requiem. RIP Apex. RIP Reverie. Your legacies and many tales will be remembered.

This is a semi-rewrite of the apex gamemode, being ported over to the latest DarkRP version. The code is somewhat a mess. Some of the code might be offensive to some audiences. Some of it is wierd too. I am willing to accept PRs to fix these issues, but I won't be providing support for this gamemode unless it is fatal.

Go ahead. Use it to your liking. Aslong as you give credit to the proper people, we're cool with it. You'll need to change alot of stuff and it will NOT work out of the box.
